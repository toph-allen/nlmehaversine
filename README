This is a hacked-together version of the nlme package which alters
the gls() and lme() functions to use great circle distance matrices
when assessing spatial autocorrelation. It was created following
instructions at:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2012-October/325174.html

To use it, you need to remove.packages("nlme") and then:

install.packages(pkgs="path/to/nlmehaversine",
  repos=NULL, type="source")

The package should then compile and install. At that point, you can
run a gls() model with great circle spatial autocorrelation with a
call such as:

gls(ft, correlation=corSpher(form= ~ lon + lat,
  metric="rdist.earth"), data=hotsample)

It's advisable to uninstall this version of the package and
reinstall the base version when you don't specifically need it.

The original readme is included below.
